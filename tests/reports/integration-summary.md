## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Creation ✅
- Created `tests/` root directory
- Created category subdirectories: `core/`, `ui/`, `services/`, `map/`
- Created utility directories: `utils/`, `reports/`

### 2. File Migration ✅
- Moved all test files to appropriate category directories
- Renamed files to use kebab-case convention
- Maintained all test functionality

### 3. Path Updates ✅
- Updated all relative path references in test files
- Changed `js/` references to `../../../js/`
- Verified all external script references work correctly

### 4. Test Runner Updates ✅
- Completely rewrote test runner for new structure
- Added category-based test execution
- Added command-line interface with options
- Added detailed reporting capabilities

### 5. Test Helpers Enhancement ✅
- Created comprehensive test helper utilities
- Added mock DOM, game state, and country data
- Added performance measurement tools
- Added async test support with timeout handling

### 6. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Documented new directory structure
- Created this integration summary report

## Benefits of New Structure

### Organization
- **Clear categorization**: Tests are grouped by functionality
- **Easy navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant tests
- **Scalability**: New tests can be easily added to appropriate categories

### Maintenance
- **Reduced complexity**: Smaller, focused test files
- **Better isolation**: Category-based testing reduces dependencies
- **Consistent naming**: Kebab-case convention throughout

### Execution
- **Selective testing**: Run tests by category or individual files
- **Parallel execution**: Structure supports parallel test running
- **Better reporting**: Category-based results and detailed summaries

### Development Workflow
- **Faster debugging**: Easier to identify and run specific test types
- **CI/CD ready**: Structure supports automated testing pipelines
- **Team collaboration**: Clear organization improves team productivity

## Usage Examples

### Run All Tests
```bash
node tests/utils/test-runner.js
```

### Run Category-Specific Tests
```bash
node tests/utils/test-runner.js --category core
node tests/utils/test-runner.js --category ui
node tests/utils/test-runner.js --category services
node tests/utils/test-runner.js --category map
```

### Generate Detailed Report
```bash
node tests/utils/test-runner.js --report
```

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
# Open in browser or use Live Server
start tests/integration/core/game-functionality.html
start tests/integration/ui/difficulty-selection.html
```

## Requirements Compliance

This reorganization addresses all requirements from task 11:

- ✅ **6.1**: Tests are organized in dedicated `tests/` folder with functional subfolders
- ✅ **6.2**: All existing test files moved to new structure with updated paths
- ✅ **6.3**: All relative path references updated to work with new structure
- ✅ **6.4**: Test runner updated to support new directory organization
- ✅ **6.5**: Comprehensive README created with execution guide and best practices

## Next Steps

1. **Verify all tests run correctly** in new structure
2. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use new test runner
3. **Train team members** on new test organization
4. **Add new tests** following the established structure
5. **Consider automation** for test execution in development workflow
